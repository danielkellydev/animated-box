## Question 1: *Markup Languages*
A markup language tells information how to look on a human readable interface. It is static, unlike programming languages. There are a number of common markup languages used today, these include:

+ HTML- Hypertext Markup Language
+ KML- Key whole Markup Language
+ MathML- Mathematical Markup Language
+ SGML- Standard Generalized Markup Language
+ XHTML- eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language
+ XML- eXtensible Markup Language

The most common and well-known is HTML.

### *Common and important components of markup languages*
<br>

1. Markup languages use **tags** to define texts. Tags are special words or characters that indicate when, and what kind of formatting should be applied to information.   [1][2]
2. **Tags come in pairs**, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The text that goes between the opening and closing tags will be altered by the given formatting. [1][2]
3. **Markup languages are easy to read.** Generally, most people should be able to read and understand a markup language, even if they don't know how to write it. [1][2]
4. Markup languages use a set of rules known as **syntax**, which define how to use the tags. This provides for  structured and consistent documents. [1][2]

The different markup languages can differ significantly, though all generally share the above features. 


## Question 2: *Packets, IP addresses, routers/routing, domains/DNS*

<br>

Across the internet, messages and data must be sent from one computing device to another, though it's not as simple as sending one whole message/file directly. Only a certain size of data can be sent across networks, and hence data and files are split up into hundreds or thousands of what are called *packets*. These *packets* are sent to the senders' nearest *router*, and then travel across the *router network* until they all reach the destination, then rejoin, and the full file is received by the receiver. It's a big network out there, and these packets need to be able to find their way; this is where *IP addresses* come in. Packets are marked with the destination *IP address*, which tells the *routers* where the packets want to end up. 

**Packets** 
<br>



**IP addresses**

IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP address is simply an address so that a given computer can be found on a network. All computers/devices on a network have a specific IP address. When data is being sent from one computer to another, *packets* are marked with the the origin IP address and destination IP address. This is how data packets are able to reach the correct destination device. <br>

IP addresses are hierachical. In the example of an IPv4 address ie. 24.147.242.217, the first numbers indicate the country/network, second numbers the region/network, the third set of numbers indicate the subnetwork, and then the final set of numbers the device itself.

***IPv4/IPv6***

IPv4 was the original version of IP address created in 1973 and widely adopted in the 1980s. It uses 32 bits per address, and is able to account for up to 4 billion unique addresses. As the internet has now become more popular than 4 billion devices, a larger IP address format has needed to be created, giving us IPv6, which is a 128 bit style of address, which is able to provide around 340 undecillion unique addresses.
